    <p class="text-muted">Effective date: {{ ("now"|datetime if false) or "2025-01-01" }}</p>

    <p>Welcome to SparkleAI, an AI voice assistant designed to support incarcerated users and their communities. By using our services (voice calls, SMS, web, and related features), you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p><strong>No prison system affiliation.</strong> SparkleAI is an independent service. We do not work with, partner with, or share data with prison systems, corrections departments, or facility vendors.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">2. Eligibility & Responsible Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the service only for lawful, non-harmful purposes.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to impersonate others or misuse voice features.</li>
      <li>Respect facility rules and applicable law.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for any charges incurred (telephony, subscriptions).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">3. Accounts, Security & Authentication</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may set an optional passphrase and voiceprint to protect your account. Keep credentials confidential.</li>
      <li>We may suspend or restrict access if we suspect fraud, non-payment, or policy violations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">4. Voice Features & Voice Cloning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you upload voice samples for cloning, you confirm you have the right to use that voice and grant SparkleAI a license to synthesize your voice for your account’s use.</li>
      <li>You must not upload samples of someone else without their explicit permission.</li>
      <li>We may refuse or remove voice models that violate rights or policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">5. Plans, Billing, Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscriptions renew per the plan shown at checkout. You can cancel at any time; cancellation stops future renewals.</li>
      <li>Refunds: we provide pro‑rata or full refunds at our reasonable discretion for service outages or billing errors. Otherwise, fees are generally non‑refundable once a billing period starts.</li>
      <li>Unpaid or lapsed accounts may be suspended until payment is made.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">6. Affiliate Program & Fair Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Affiliates earn a $10 signup bonus and tiered recurring commissions on referred subscriptions. Tiers may increase commission percentage and/or residual duration based on total signups and recent signup velocity. Details are shown in your affiliate dashboard and may change with notice.</li>
      <li>Residual commissions apply only to active paid subscriptions within the applicable tier window. Overrides (e.g., upline) may be lower and subject to separate rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Fair use:</strong> no spam, fraud, self‑referrals, multiple accounts for the same person, or misleading claims. We may reverse commissions tied to fraud, chargebacks, or refunds.</li>
      <li>Payout methods include Commissary, PayPal, or Crypto. Minimum withdrawal is $10; additional verification may apply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">7. Crypto Payout Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Crypto payouts are experimental and carry risk, including potential loss of funds if you provide an incorrect wallet or due to network issues. Transactions may be irreversible. You are responsible for ensuring the destination address and network are correct.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">8. Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for their own purposes. See the Privacy Policy for details on data handling. We do not provide data to prison systems.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">9. Service Changes & Availability</h2>
    <p>We may update features, pricing, or availability. We will aim to provide reasonable notice for material changes.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">10. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>SparkleAI is provided “as is”. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim implied warranties and limit liability for indirect or consequential damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; rights may vary.</p>
