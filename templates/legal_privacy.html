    <h1 class="mb-4">SparkleAI Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="text-muted">Effective date: {{ ("now"|datetime if false) or "2025-01-01" }}</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Overview</h2>
    <p>SparkleAI helps incarcerated users and their communities access conversational assistance by voice and SMS. We design our system to minimize data collection and to respect privacy.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">We Do Not Work With Prison Systems</h2>
    <p>We are independent and do not work with, partner with, or share data with prison systems, corrections departments, or facility vendors.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Account data: phone number, optional name, facility code, and preferences (e.g., voice, passphrase).</li>
      <li>Usage data: timestamps and counts for calls/SMS; optional transcripts to improve quality and safety.</li>
      <li>Payment metadata: plan and status. Card data is handled by processors and not stored by us.</li>
      <li>Affiliate data: referral codes, earnings, and payout preferences.</li>
      <li>Voice cloning assets: optional audio you upload; stored only for your account’s use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide the service (answer by voice/SMS, apply your settings).</li>
      <li>To maintain security (passphrase and optional voiceprint matching).</li>
      <li>To operate billing, affiliates, and support.</li>
      <li>To improve quality, including model prompts and safeguards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">No Third‑Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for their own purposes. Limited service providers (e.g., telephony and payments) process data <em>on our behalf</em> solely to deliver the service, and they do not have permission to use your data for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as needed to provide the service, comply with law, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements. You may request deletion; we will delete what we control unless retention is legally required.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No method is 100% secure; please keep your passphrase confidential.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Voice Cloning Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Uploading voice samples grants SparkleAI a limited license to store and synthesize that voice for your account.</li>
      <li>You must have the right to the voice you upload and agree not to upload someone else’s voice without consent.</li>
      <li>You can request deletion of your stored samples and models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Affiliate Program & Payouts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We track referrals to calculate earnings according to the program rules (e.g., $10 signup bonus, 5% recurring up to 5 years).</li>
      <li>Payout options may include Commissary, PayPal, and Crypto; we store the details you provide for payouts.</li>
      <li><strong>Crypto payout risk:</strong> crypto transfers are high‑risk and may be irreversible. Ensure your wallet details are correct.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Children</h2>
    <p>SparkleAI is not directed to children under 13. Do not use the service if you are under the age threshold in your jurisdiction.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy. Material changes will be posted here with an updated effective date.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions or requests (including data deletion)? Contact the email listed on our website.</p>
